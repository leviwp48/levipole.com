Going to migrate from react bootstrap to regular bootstrap since it provides
a later version of bootstrap.

I a using a MongoDB database provided by mLab and I am going to host my 
site on AWS

I can pretty much copy the layout of adam's or alec's site. 

but I have the functionality down I just need to add the styling and 
then add content. I'll do that through the client I think? Or maybe the backend.
