For this site I want it to hold the projects I have worked on.
Where I'm from and what I do.
Contact Info.

This will be a single page with a clean look.

I am going to try to use MongoDB for this site. I don't need a complex database for my projects.

I had more notes but I lost them.
------------------------

Game Plan:

- Need to change how the site looks with react
- Need to have it running on as
- Need to change functionality to fit my idea
    - remove user add project/delete
- Add my information for my site
